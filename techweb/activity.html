            <h3><b>Grand adventure games for the Curious Mind</b></h3>
            <p>the grand adventure games,which our experienced gamers and mentors choose, require huge exploration journey to the world of science. We dig deep into the wonders of chemistry, biology, astronomy, physics and even engineering. <br><br>Some puzzles might require to learn coding, maybe some mathematical brain twisters are hidden in the game's world. Together we create a project, roll our sleeves and get cracking on those pesky puzzles.for ex: Minecraftt, Legend of Zelda, Honkai star rail,Elden Ring and etc.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><b>Dynamic Problem-Solving:</b> In a strategy game like Civilization, you must solve problems with limited resources, adapting to a changing map and unpredictable AI opponents.</li>

                <li><b>Trial, Error & Iteration:</b> Games like Dark Souls or Celeste teach players to analyze failure, learn from mistakes, and iteratively refine their approach until they succeed.</li>
                
                <li><b>Algorithmic Thinking:</b> Games like Factorio or Opus Magnum require players to design and optimize complex sequences of actions (algorithms) to automate production or solve puzzles efficiently.</li>

                <li><b>Pattern Recognition:</b> Succeeding in competitive shooters like Counter-Strike or puzzle games like Tetris depends on rapidly identifying and predicting patterns in opponent behavior or falling blocks.</li>

            <h3><b>Activities that make learning to code an adventure</b></h3>
            <p>Forget dry textbooks and boring lectures. The new frontier of learning to code is interactive, game-like, and incredibly fun. We will be learning back-end and front-end programming languages with websites, such as:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>CodeCombat & Ozaria: Learn to Code by Slaying Dragons</li>
                <li>Scratch & ScratchJr: The Digital LEGO® for Budding Creators</li>
                <li>SQL Island & SQL Police Department: Learn Databases by Telling a Story</li>
            </ul>
